# Decentralized Donation System

## Description

This project introduces a revolutionary solution to address the transparency concerns in the world of charitable donations. Leveraging blockchain technology, we provide a decentralized donation system that empowers donors with the ability to trace their contributions and monitor the utilization of their funds. Smart contracts play a pivotal role in ensuring that contributors have full visibility into the details of their donations, marking a new era in charitable giving.
